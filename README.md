Password Generator Project

Password generator that has preset values for capital and lower case letters, numbers, and pre-determined special characters.  User inputs the quantity of characters they would like their password to be and the generator will deliver it.

Criteria is set between 8-128 letters long and the user must input a number in this range.  If outside the category or NaN, it will prompt the user of the criteria/what they need to do to get to the confirm messages for the rest of the criteria.
